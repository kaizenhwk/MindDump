## ✅ COMPLETION RULES

### User Story Completion
- ✅ All acceptance criteria implemented
- ✅ All unit tests written and passing
- ✅ Manual testing completed
- ✅ Status changed to 🟢 Complete

### Epic Completion - ALL REQUIREMENTS MANDATORY
**⚠️ CRITICAL: An epic can ONLY be marked as 🟢 Complete when ALL of the following are satisfied:**

- ✅ **Integration tests written and passing** (Component interaction testing)
- ✅ **End-to-end tests written and passing** (Complete user workflow testing)
- ✅ **Epic demo successfully completed** (Stakeholder demonstration)

**🚫 INCOMPLETE EPICS:** If ANY of the above requirements are missing, the epic status remains 🟡 In Progress or 🔴 Not Started.

### Testing Flow - Three-Tier Testing Strategy
**All three test types are REQUIRED for epic completion:**

1. **Unit Tests** → Test individual components/functions in isolation
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test component rendering, props, state changes
   - Test service functions and utilities
   - Minimum 90% code coverage per component

2. **Integration Tests** → Test component interactions within epic scope
   - Test data flow between components
   - Test API integrations and service interactions
   - Test localStorage/state management integration
   - Test user interactions across multiple components

3. **E2E Tests** → Test complete epic functionality as real user experience
   - Test complete user workflows from start to finish
   - Test cross-browser compatibility
   - Test responsive design on different devices
   - Test accessibility compliance
   - Test error handling and edge cases

### Quality Gates
- **Unit Tests:** Must achieve >90% coverage and 100% pass rate
- **Integration Tests:** Must cover all component interactions within epic
- **E2E Tests:** Must cover all user workflows defined in epic acceptance criteria
- **Manual Testing:** Must be completed and documented before epic closure
